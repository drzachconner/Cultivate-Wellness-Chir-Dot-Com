      <h1>What to Expect at Your First Visit</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">A Technology-Driven Path to Understanding Your Nervous System</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <div class="intro-box">
        <p>As a parent, there's nothing more heartbreaking than watching your child struggle and feeling powerless to help. Perhaps you've already explored various treatment options—from traditional chiropractic care to occupational therapy—but something still feels missing. You're not alone in this journey, and there's hope for a different approach.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>What if we told you there was a way to understand exactly what's happening in your or your child's nervous system?</strong> A method that doesn't rely on guesswork but instead uses cutting-edge technology to create precise, personalized care plans? This is exactly what our Neurologically-Focused approach offers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Our Promise:</strong> No rushed appointments. No cookie-cutter care. We take the time to truly understand your complete health story and use advanced technology to see exactly what's happening in your nervous system—so your care plan is precise and personalized to YOU.
      </div>

      <h2>Our Unique 5-Step Process to Better Health</h2>
      <p>Our approach is systematic and thorough, designed to uncover and address the root causes of your health challenges:</p>

      <div class="step-card">
        <h3><span class="step-number">1</span> In-Depth Consultation</h3>
        <p>Unlike rushed medical visits, we take the time to truly understand your complete health journey. For children, this includes pregnancy and birth history, early developmental milestones, and every factor that may have contributed to current challenges.</p>
        <p>This comprehensive history helps us identify potential root causes that other providers might miss. We're looking for the "Perfect Storm" of factors—birth trauma, early illnesses, toxins, stress—that may have led to nervous system dysfunction.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete health history from pregnancy through present</li>
          <li>Previous treatments and what has or hasn't worked</li>
          <li>Current symptoms and daily challenges</li>
          <li>Your goals and hopes for care</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <h3><span class="step-number">2</span> Advanced INSiGHT Scans (COREscore)</h3>
        <p>We utilize state-of-the-art technology to measure your nervous system function. These scans detect three crucial factors that other providers often miss:</p>

        <div class="scan-box">
          <h4>What Our Scans Measure:</h4>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li><strong>Subluxation Patterns:</strong> Areas of spinal misalignment creating nerve interference</li>
            <li><strong>Dysautonomia:</strong> Imbalance between "fight or flight" and "rest and digest" states</li>
            <li><strong>Vagus Nerve Dysfunction:</strong> Affecting digestion, heart rate, emotional regulation, immune function</li>
            <li><strong>Surface EMG:</strong> Measuring muscle tension patterns along the spine</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV):</strong> Your body's ability to adapt to stress</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal Scanning:</strong> Detecting areas of autonomic imbalance</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This gives us <strong>objective data</strong> about your neurological health—taking the guesswork out of care. The scans are completely non-invasive, painless, and take about 10-15 minutes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <h3><span class="step-number">3</span> Customized Care Plan Development</h3>
        <p>We blend your unique history with your scan results to create a precisely tailored care plan. There are no "cookie-cutter" approaches here—every aspect of care is specifically calculated for optimal results:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specific adjustment frequency based on your severity and chronicity</li>
          <li>Estimated timeline with realistic expectations</li>
          <li>Milestone markers to track your progress</li>
          <li>Re-scan schedule to measure objective improvement</li>
          <li>Investment options and family plans</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <h3><span class="step-number">4</span> Comprehensive Report of Findings</h3>
        <p>We take time to explain everything we've discovered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Walk through your scan results with clear, visual explanations</li>
          <li>Connect your health history to what we see in the nervous system</li>
          <li>Explain exactly what we found and what it means for you</li>
          <li>Answer all your questions thoroughly</li>
          <li>Outline clear next steps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'll leave understanding your (or your child's) nervous system better than ever before—and with a clear path forward.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <h3><span class="step-number">5</span> Gentle, Effective Adjustments</h3>
        <p>Our adjustments are safe, gentle, and specifically designed for all ages—from newborns to seniors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Talsky Tonal Chiropractic (TTC):</strong> Working with meningeal system tension for deep neurological impact</li>
          <li><strong>ArthroStim Instrument:</strong> Precise, comfortable corrections using gentle instrumentation</li>
          <li><strong>No cracking, popping, or twisting:</strong> So gentle that babies often sleep through adjustments</li>
          <li><strong>Position-specific adjusting:</strong> We can adjust you in the exact posture that causes your symptoms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each adjustment helps release tension and stress from the nervous system, often leading to improved sleep, behavior, digestion, focus, and overall well-being.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Will I get adjusted on my first visit?</h4>
        <p>Typically, no. We believe in doing a thorough evaluation first and taking time to explain our findings before beginning care. Your first adjustment usually happens at your second visit (Report of Findings) after you fully understand what we've found.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Is it safe for my baby/child?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely. Our techniques are so gentle that babies often sleep through their adjustments. We've cared for newborns just days old and have extensive experience with children of all ages and abilities—including those with sensory sensitivities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>What if I'm nervous about chiropractic?</h4>
        <p>Many of our patients felt the same way! Our gentle, instrument-based techniques are nothing like traditional "cracking" adjustments. There's no twisting, popping, or sudden movements. Most people find our care relaxing and comfortable.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How long until I see results?</h4>
        <p>This varies based on your specific situation. Some people notice changes immediately; others take several weeks. We'll give you realistic expectations based on your scan results and health history, and we track progress with periodic re-scans so you can see objective improvement.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do I need a referral?</h4>
        <p>No referral is needed. You can come directly to us.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Taking the First Step</h2>
      <p>Just like countless families before you, you deserve answers and real solutions for your health challenges. Our Neurologically-Focused approach has helped children overcome challenges that seemed insurmountable—sensory issues, chronic illness, developmental delays, behavioral challenges, and more.</p>
      <p>The transformation starts with understanding exactly what's happening in your or your child's nervous system.</p>
