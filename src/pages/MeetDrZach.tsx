              Every day since my graduation from Life University in Georgia as a chiropractor, I have been blessed with the opportunity to contribute to the transformative stories and results we see with the help of neurologically-focused chiropractic care. These stories inspire me and reinforce my belief in the potential of the human body to heal and optimize itself. This belief is not theoretical but deeply personal, born from my own experiences with the gentle neurologically-focused approach that I passionately advocate and teach.

                I am on a mission to bring this transformative chiropractic care to my community. My journey as a chiropractor began at Life University, where I attended over 60 seminars on various chiropractic techniques. During this time, I was drawn towards Talsky Tonal Chiropractic because of its respect for the intelligence of the body and its highly effective, yet very gentle application. It was a passion that led me to become one of only two authorized teachers for this work.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                My love for chiropractic care was further fueled by an internship at a neurologically-focused office with an emphasis on children with special needs. This experience solidified my belief in the transformative power of this unique approach. It also revealed a void for this type of life-changing care. I have since dedicated my career to filling this void and becoming a beacon of hope for the families in my community.

                My journey into chiropractic care began during my university years. I was drawn to the idea of the body's innate intelligence, its ability to heal itself, and how chiropractic care can optimize this process.

Inspired by these experiences, my commitment is to extend this life-enhancing care to as many children and families as possible.
