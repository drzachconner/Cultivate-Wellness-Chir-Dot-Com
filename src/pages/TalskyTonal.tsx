            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Talsky Tonal Chiropractic is an advanced chiropractic approach developed by Dr. Marvin
              Talsky in 2001. Dr. Talsky, who has been practicing since 1965 and graduated from Palmer
              College of Chiropractic in 1963, co-founded the renowned Torque Release Technique in 1995
              before developing this unique tonal method.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              This technique represents a paradigm shift in chiropractic care. Rather than simply addressing
              symptoms, Talsky Tonal Chiropractic focuses on finding and releasing accumulated stress patterns
              in the body, restoring the integrity and function of your nervous system so your body can heal
              and perform at its optimal level.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Understanding "Stress Stuck On"</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              When your body becomes overwhelmed with stress, it increases tension proportionate to that
              stress and holds that tension pattern until it receives information letting it know that it's
              safe to release. We refer to this as "stress stuck on" or in chiropractic terms, "subluxation."
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              These tension patterns accumulate in layers upon layers, filling what we call the "stress bucket."
              Your body can only hold so much stress before symptoms start to occur and the brain's ability to
              properly communicate with the rest of the body becomes interfered with by these layers of
              unnecessary held tension.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-8">How Talsky Tonal Chiropractic Works</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Talsky Tonal Chiropractic utilizes gentle bio-feedback responses through balancing to identify
              exactly where your body is holding onto tension that it no longer needs. Instead of forceful
              manipulations, this approach uses gentle and very specific adjustments that respect your body's
              intelligence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              TTC finds this "stress stuck on" and gives your body the space, permission, and information it
              needs to release these layers of tension held in the body. Your body then learns how to better
              and better adjust itself. This technique is empowering to the body rather than forcing it,
              leading to the potential of never-ending optimization with continued wellness care.
