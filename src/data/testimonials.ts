    text: 'Dr. Zach has a very warm and welcoming atmosphere in his office, I felt very calm and well taken care of during our session. He takes his time to understand your concerns and does an amazing job with being able to pin point those issues. He also gave me some great advice and tips on how to help keep up with progress we\'ve made. I\'ve had 4 sessions so far with Dr. Zach and each time I get the results I was hoping for, which makes me excited to go back!',
