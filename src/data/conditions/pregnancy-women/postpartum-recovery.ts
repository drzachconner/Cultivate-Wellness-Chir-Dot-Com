  intro: [
    'The postpartum period is a time of tremendous change for your body. After nine months of pregnancy and the physical demands of birth, your body needs support to recover and adapt to the new demands of motherhood. Chiropractic care can help you heal faster, feel better, and care for your baby with more comfort and energy.',
    'Whether you had a vaginal birth or C-section, your body has been through an extraordinary physical journey. Hormonal changes continue affecting ligaments for months postpartum, nursing and holding baby create new postural stresses, sleep deprivation affects muscle function and healing, and your core and pelvic floor need time to recover. You matter too. Taking care of yourself helps you take better care of your little one.',

      question: 'When can I start postpartum chiropractic care?',
      answer:
        'After a vaginal birth, you can often begin care within days of delivery. After a C-section, we usually wait 4-6 weeks for incision healing, then begin gently. However, it\'s never too late. Even years postpartum, we can address lingering issues from pregnancy and birth.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I bring my baby to appointments?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely! We welcome babies at appointments. Many new moms bring their infants, and we can even check your baby while you\'re here. Addressing nervous system tension from birth can help with feeding, sleeping, and development.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is chiropractic safe while breastfeeding?',
      answer:
        'Yes, completely safe. Chiropractic care involves no medications and is entirely compatible with breastfeeding. In fact, many moms find that addressing upper back and neck tension from nursing positions makes breastfeeding more comfortable.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I had a C-section. Can chiropractic help?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Cesarean birth involves significant abdominal surgery, and the resulting scar tissue, core weakness, and compensatory movement patterns often benefit from gentle chiropractic care. We take your surgical recovery into account and adapt our approach accordingly.',

    {
      question: 'What about "Mom Thumb" or wrist pain?',
      answer:
        'De Quervain\'s tenosynovitis (commonly called "Mom Thumb") is very common from the repetitive lifting, holding, and positioning involved in caring for a newborn. We can help address the nerve and joint components contributing to wrist and thumb pain.',
