  intro: [
    'Back pain during pregnancy is incredibly common. Up to 70% of pregnant women experience it. But "common" doesn\'t mean you have to suffer through it. At Cultivate Wellness, we provide safe, gentle, drug-free relief for pregnancy-related back pain that is specifically adapted for the needs of expectant mothers.',
    'As your body changes during pregnancy, your center of gravity shifts forward, hormonal changes loosen ligaments, and your growing baby adds stress to your spine and pelvis. These changes often cause lower back pain, sacroiliac joint pain, round ligament pain, and sciatica. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses these issues safely and effectively, supporting a more comfortable pregnancy.',

      question: 'When should I start chiropractic care during pregnancy?',
      answer:
        'You can start at any point during pregnancy. Many patients begin in the second trimester when back pain typically starts, but others begin earlier for proactive support or later when symptoms develop. It\'s also safe to start care in the third trimester.',

    {
      question: 'How often should I come in during pregnancy?',

    {
      question: 'Will I need to lie face-down?',

      question: 'Can chiropractic help turn a breech baby?',
      answer:
        'While chiropractic care does not directly turn babies, the Webster Technique (which we offer) addresses sacral tension and pelvic balance.
