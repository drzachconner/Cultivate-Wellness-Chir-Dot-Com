      question: 'What exactly is the Webster Technique?',
      answer:
        'The Webster Technique is a specific chiropractic sacral analysis and diversified adjustment. It focuses on reducing the effects of sacral subluxation and SI joint dysfunction, improving neurobiomechanical function in the sacral and pelvic region. It was developed specifically for pregnant mothers and is taught through the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association (ICPA).',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the Webster Technique turn breech babies?',
      answer:
        'No. As chiropractors, we care for the mother, not the baby. We do not turn, reposition, or treat the fetus in any way. The Webster Technique optimizes the mother\'s pelvic biomechanics and nervous system function. When the mother\'s pelvis is properly aligned and functioning optimally, her body is better able to support a healthy pregnancy. Any changes in fetal positioning occur naturally as a result of the mother\'s improved physiology.',

    {
      question: 'When should I start Webster Technique care?',
      answer:
        'The technique is beneficial throughout all trimesters. While many mothers seek care later in pregnancy, starting earlier allows us to maintain pelvic balance from the beginning as your body changes. There is no wrong time to start.',

    {
      question: 'Is the Webster Technique safe during pregnancy?',

      question: 'How often will I need to come in?',
