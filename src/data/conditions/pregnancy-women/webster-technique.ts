  intro: [
    'During pregnancy, there is inevitably a degree of asymmetry in the tension of the pelvic muscles and ligaments as your body adapts to support your growing baby. At Cultivate Wellness, our doctors are certified in the Webster Technique through the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association (ICPA) and use a specific analysis to identify this imbalance.',
    'In conjunction with gentle tonal chiropractic adjustments, we use this analysis to identify areas of pelvic imbalance and gently engage certain muscles and ligaments to help restore proper balance and normal function. Many mothers experience improved comfort throughout their pregnancy, and the technique is often associated with encouraging optimal positioning of the baby.',

      question: 'Does the Webster Technique turn breech babies?',
      answer:
        'As chiropractors, we care for the mother, not the baby. We do not use intent with our analysis or application to turn, reposition, or treat the baby in any way. What we do is work to restore proper pelvic balance and nervous system function for the mother. When the pelvis is balanced and functioning well, the body is better able to support the natural processes of pregnancy. The technique is often associated with encouraging optimal positioning, but any changes occur naturally as a result of the mother\'s improved function.',

      question: 'When should I start Webster Technique care?',
      answer:
        'The technique is beneficial throughout all trimesters. While many mothers seek care later in pregnancy, starting earlier allows us to maintain pelvic balance from the beginning as your body changes. There is no wrong time to start.',
