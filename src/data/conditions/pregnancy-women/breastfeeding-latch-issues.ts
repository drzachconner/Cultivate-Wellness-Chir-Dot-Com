  intro: [
    'Struggling to breastfeed your newborn can be exhausting, frustrating, and heartbreaking. If you\'ve tried everything -- different positions, lactation consultants, nipple shields -- and your baby still struggles to latch or nurse effectively, there may be tension on the nervous system that gentle chiropractic care can address.',
    'Effective breastfeeding requires coordinated movement of the jaw, tongue, neck, and cranial bones. Birth -- especially long, difficult, or assisted deliveries -- can create "stress stuck on" in the neurospinal system, particularly around the brainstem, that interferes with the nerves involved in sucking, swallowing, and jaw function. Releasing this held tension can be the key to a successful breastfeeding journey.',

Birth can leave "stress stuck on" in the nervous system, creating held tension patterns that interfere with the nerves needed for effective nursing.

      question: 'How gentle is the treatment for newborns?',
      answer:
        'Extremely gentle. The pressure used is lighter than what you\'d use to check a ripe tomato. There is no cracking or forceful manipulation -- ever. Baby often sleeps through the adjustment. Parents stay with their baby the entire time and care is adapted to baby\'s comfort level.',

      question: 'How does chiropractic help with tongue tie?',
      answer:
        'If your baby has been diagnosed with a tongue tie or lip tie, chiropractic care can be valuable before the release (improving mobility for a more effective procedure), after the release (helping the body adapt to new range of motion), and addressing compensatory tension patterns that developed while the tie was present.',

    {
      question: 'How many visits will it take?',
      answer:
        'Many babies show improvement within 1-4 visits. Some respond after just one session, while others need a few more visits. Dr. Zach will create a personalized plan and monitor progress closely. Sessions are brief and focused.',

    {
      question: 'Do you work with lactation consultants?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Breastfeeding issues often require a team approach. We coordinate with lactation consultants (IBCLCs), pediatricians, pediatric dentists, and speech/feeding therapists. Chiropractic addresses the neurospinal tension component while other providers address technique, supply, and other factors.',

      question: 'When should I bring my baby in?',
      answer:
        'As soon as you notice feeding difficulties. Newborns are welcome at any age -- we see babies as young as hours old. The sooner nervous system tension is addressed, the sooner breastfeeding can improve. Don\'t wait until you\'re at the point of giving up.',
