    'If you\'ve noticed a flat spot on your baby\'s head, you\'re not alone. Plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) affects nearly half of all infants to some degree. At Cultivate Wellness, we help address the underlying factors that contribute to uneven head shape, using extraordinarily gentle techniques designed specifically for newborns and infants.',
    'Plagiocephaly often develops because a baby consistently lies with their head turned to one side, frequently due to torticollis (tight neck muscles) or upper cervical tension. Rather than simply waiting it out or relying solely on repositioning, our neurologically-focused approach addresses the root cause, helping your baby move their head freely so the skull can develop symmetrically.',

      question: 'How early can my baby be checked for plagiocephaly?',
      answer:
        'Babies can be evaluated within the first few weeks of life. In fact, the earlier we identify and address contributing factors like cervical neurological tension, the faster the head shape typically improves. Our doctors regularly see newborns just days old.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for a baby with a flat head?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our doctors use incredibly gentle techniques specifically designed for infants. The pressure is lighter than what you\'d use to check a ripe tomato. There is no cracking or twisting. Parents are with their baby the entire time, and babies often sleep through their adjustments.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will my baby need a helmet?',
      answer:
        'Many babies improve with chiropractic care, repositioning, and tummy time alone, especially when addressed early. In moderate to severe cases, helmet therapy may be recommended in addition to chiropractic care. Our team will give you an honest assessment and work alongside your pediatrician or craniofacial specialist.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What causes plagiocephaly?',
      answer:
        'Common causes include torticollis (tight neck muscles), prolonged time in one position (car seats, swings, cribs), birth trauma (especially vacuum or forceps-assisted delivery), premature birth, and in-utero positioning. Multiple factors often contribute together.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will my baby need?',
      answer:
        'Since every baby is different, we determine the right care plan after completing a thorough history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans (if age-appropriate). This allows us to understand your baby\'s unique situation and recommend a plan tailored to their needs. We monitor progress at each visit and adjust accordingly. Early intervention typically leads to faster improvement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does plagiocephaly cause developmental problems?',
      answer:
        'While mild plagiocephaly is primarily cosmetic, research suggests that the underlying factors (like cervical restriction and torticollis) can affect developmental milestones, feeding, and overall neurological function. Addressing these factors supports your baby\'s development on multiple levels.',
