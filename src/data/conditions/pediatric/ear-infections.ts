    'Ear infections (otitis media) are one of the most common reasons children visit the doctor, and one of the top reasons for antibiotic prescriptions. But what if there was a drug-free way to help your child break the cycle of recurrent ear infections? At Cultivate Wellness, we\'ve helped countless children find relief through gentle, neurologically-focused chiropractic care.',
    'Five out of six children will have at least one ear infection by age 3. Children are more prone because their Eustachian tubes are more horizontal, shorter, and narrower than adults\', making it harder for fluid to drain from the middle ear. When fluid can\'t drain properly, it creates a perfect environment for bacteria to grow, leading to infection.',

The nerves controlling the muscles of the Eustachian tube originate in the upper neck. When this neurology is under tension from birth and/or early life trauma (physical, chemical, and/or emotional) it can create the conditions that lead to recurrent ear infections, regardless of how many rounds of antibiotics are prescribed.',

      question: 'How does chiropractic help with ear infections?',
      answer:
        'The neurology in the upper cervical spine (neck) and occiput directly affects the nerves and muscles controlling Eustachian tube function. When stress is stuck on in this area from birth or early life trauma, it creates tension that disrupts normal drainage. By helping the nervous system release these old patterns, we address the root cause rather than just treating symptoms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this safe for young children?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our doctors use extremely gentle techniques adapted specifically for children. There is no cracking or forceful manipulation. The adjustments are so gentle that babies and toddlers often sleep through them or barely notice.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should we stop antibiotics?',
      answer:
        'We are not anti-antibiotic. Sometimes they are necessary. Chiropractic care offers a complementary approach that can reduce the frequency and severity of infections, potentially reducing the need for antibiotics over time. Always consult your pediatrician regarding medication decisions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic help my child avoid ear tubes?',
      answer:
        'Many parents have found that chiropractic care allowed their children to avoid or delay ear tube surgery. While tubes are sometimes necessary, it is worth trying a conservative approach first. Ear tubes don\'t address why infections keep occurring. Chiropractic care does.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I still see a pediatrician?',
      answer:
        'See your pediatrician if your child has a high fever (over 102 degrees F), severe pain, discharge from the ear, symptoms lasting more than 2-3 days, or signs of hearing loss. Chiropractic care is excellent for prevention and supporting overall ear health alongside medical care.',
