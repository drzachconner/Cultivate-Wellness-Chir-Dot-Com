  intro: [
    'Few things are more distressing for parents than a baby who won\'t stop crying. Colic affects up to 25% of infants, leaving families exhausted and desperate for answers. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer gentle, effective care that addresses the underlying nervous system factors contributing to colic and infant digestive distress.',
    'While the exact cause of colic isn\'t fully understood, several factors may contribute -- including an immature digestive system, nervous system overwhelm, trapped gas, food sensitivities, birth trauma, and spinal misalignment affecting nerve function to digestive organs. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses the root cause rather than masking symptoms.',

      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for a colicky newborn?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Dr. Zach uses incredibly gentle techniques designed specifically for infants. The pressure is lighter than you\'d use to check a ripe tomato. There is no cracking or popping. Babies often sleep through their adjustments, and many visibly relax during care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will we see results?',
      answer:
        'While every baby is unique, many parents notice improvement within 1 to 3 visits. Some babies show dramatic reduction in crying after the very first adjustment. Dr. Zach will create a care plan tailored to your baby and monitor progress closely.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What other digestive issues can chiropractic help with?',
      answer:
        'Beyond colic, we help with reflux (GERD), constipation, excessive gas pain, feeding difficulties, and situations where digestive issues are affecting growth. The nervous system controls all digestive function, so supporting its proper function can help a wide range of symptoms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I bring my baby in?',
      answer:
        'We recommend evaluation if your baby has been diagnosed with colic, cries inconsolably for extended periods, shows signs of digestive distress, had a difficult or interventional birth, has feeding difficulties, seems uncomfortable or in pain, or has been treated for reflux without improvement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still see my pediatrician while getting chiropractic care?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Chiropractic care is complementary to your pediatrician\'s care. We encourage you to continue working with your child\'s medical team. We are happy to communicate with your pediatrician about your baby\'s care.',
