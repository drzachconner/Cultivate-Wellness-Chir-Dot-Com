  intro: [
    'Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is stressful for children and parents alike. If your child is still wetting the bed past age 5-6, you\'re not alone, and there may be a solution you haven\'t considered. Chiropractic care has helped many children overcome bedwetting by addressing the underlying nervous system issues that control bladder function.',
    'Approximately 15% of 5-year-olds still wet the bed, affecting over 5 million children in the United States. Bedwetting is almost never behavioral or psychological. It\'s typically a developmental or neurological issue. Your child isn\'t lazy or doing this on purpose. Chiropractic care addresses the physical component that may be preventing their body from controlling this natural function.',

      question: 'How does chiropractic help with bedwetting?',
      answer:
        'The nerves controlling bladder function exit the spine in the lower back and sacral region. When there is neurological tension in this area, it can interfere with the nerve signals that tell the brain the bladder is full, tell the bladder muscles to hold urine, and wake the child when needed. Gentle adjustments restore proper nerve communication.',

      answer:
        'Absolutely not. Bedwetting is almost never behavioral or psychological. It is typically a developmental or neurological issue. Your child is not lazy or doing this on purpose. Being patient and supportive, and never punishing for accidents, is important for their self-esteem.',

      question: 'How many visits will my child need?',
      answer:

      question: 'What can we do at home to help?',
      answer:
        'You can support your child by limiting fluids before bed, ensuring they use the bathroom right before sleep, being patient and supportive, protecting their self-esteem (reminding them this is common and not their fault), and keeping follow-up appointments consistent.',

      question: 'What age is bedwetting considered a problem?',
      answer:
        'Bedwetting is considered common and normal up to around age 5-6. After that, it is worth exploring whether there is a neurological or structural component that can be addressed. The sooner it is addressed, the better, both for results and for your child\'s confidence.',
