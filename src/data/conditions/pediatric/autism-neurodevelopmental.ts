  intro: [
    'At Cultivate Wellness, we have deep expertise and genuine passion for caring for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), sensory processing differences, and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach helps optimize nervous system function, supporting better regulation, communication, and quality of life.',
    'Autism and neurodevelopmental conditions are fundamentally neurological in nature. While chiropractic care does not "treat" or "cure" autism, it can profoundly support nervous system function. The nervous system controls everything -- sensory processing, motor control, digestion, sleep, emotional regulation, and immune function. When spinal misalignments create interference, they disrupt the flow of information between brain and body. Removing that interference supports better overall function.',
