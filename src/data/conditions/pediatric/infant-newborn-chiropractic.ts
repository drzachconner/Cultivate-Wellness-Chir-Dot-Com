    'The first months and years of life are the most critical for your baby\'s development. At Cultivate Wellness, we specialize in caring for the tiniest patients -- from hours-old newborns to curious toddlers taking their first steps. Our ultra-gentle techniques ensure your baby gets the best possible start.',
    'Birth is often the most physically traumatic event of our lives. Even "normal" deliveries involve significant forces on a baby\'s delicate spine and nervous system. Up to 60-90 lbs of force can be applied to a baby\'s head and neck during natural delivery, while C-sections, vacuum or forceps deliveries, prolonged labor, and breech positions create their own unique stresses. Even in the gentlest circumstances, birth can create misalignments that affect your baby\'s nervous system function, feeding, sleep, and development.',
