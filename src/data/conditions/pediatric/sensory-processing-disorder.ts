  intro: [
    'Sensory Processing Disorder affects how the brain receives and responds to information from the senses. For children with SPD, everyday experiences can be overwhelming, confusing, or underwhelming. At Cultivate Wellness, we specialize in supporting children with sensory differences through gentle, neurologically-focused care.',
    'SPD is not about the senses themselves working incorrectly -- it\'s about how the brain processes the information it receives. The brain must receive sensory input, filter what\'s important, integrate information from multiple senses, generate appropriate responses, and regulate arousal levels. This is fundamentally a nervous system function, which is why supporting nervous system health can be so helpful.',

Chiropractic care removes this interference, allowing the nervous system to process sensory information more effectively.

      question: 'How does chiropractic help with sensory processing?',
      answer:
        'Sensory processing is a nervous system function. The brain must receive, filter, integrate, and respond to sensory input. When the spine is misaligned, it creates interference in this communication system. Chiropractic care removes the interference, allowing the nervous system to process sensory information more effectively.',

    {
      question: 'My child is very touch-sensitive. How do you handle that?',
      answer:
        'We completely understand and respect touch sensitivities. We never rush and always read your child\'s verbal and non-verbal cues. We can modify our approach, use lighter touch, let your child sit in your lap, or take breaks as needed. Many touch-sensitive children come to enjoy and look forward to their adjustments after the first few visits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does SPD occur with other conditions?',
      answer:
        'Yes. SPD frequently co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder (up to 90% have sensory differences), ADHD, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and auditory processing disorder. Our comprehensive approach addresses the whole child, whatever their diagnosis or combination of challenges.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic work alongside occupational therapy?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Chiropractic care works beautifully alongside occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, counseling, and sensory diet programs. We address the nervous system foundation while these therapies build specific skills. We are happy to coordinate with your child\'s other providers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I tell you before our first visit?',
      answer:
        'Please share any specific sensory triggers or preferences your child has before your visit. The more we know, the better we can accommodate their needs. Let us know about clothing sensitivities, sound triggers, lighting preferences, and what helps your child feel safe in new environments.',
