  intro: [
    'Tongue tie (ankyloglossia) and lip tie are conditions where the frenulum -- the small band of tissue connecting the tongue to the floor of the mouth or the lip to the gum -- is too tight or short, restricting movement. These tethered oral tissues can significantly affect breastfeeding, bottle feeding, and your baby\'s overall comfort. At Cultivate Wellness, we provide gentle chiropractic support that complements the care your baby receives from lactation consultants and pediatric dentists.',
    'Many parents don\'t realize that tongue and lip ties often coexist with upper cervical misalignment and tension patterns throughout the baby\'s body. Birth trauma, in-utero positioning, and compensatory tension from restricted oral tissues can all contribute to spinal misalignment that further impairs feeding ability. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses these underlying factors to support better outcomes.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care fix a tongue tie?',
      answer:
        'No. A tongue tie or lip tie requires a frenectomy (release procedure) performed by a qualified pediatric dentist or ENT. What chiropractic care does is address the compensatory tension patterns and spinal misalignments that develop alongside ties, which significantly improves feeding function and supports better outcomes from the release.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When should my baby be seen -- before or after the release?',
      answer:
        'Ideally both. Care before the frenectomy helps release compensatory tension patterns, often improving feeding even before the procedure. Care after the release helps the body adapt to the new range of motion and prevents old tension patterns from limiting improvement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How soon after a frenectomy can my baby be adjusted?',
      answer:
        'Many providers recommend chiropractic care within 24-48 hours after the release to help the body integrate the new range of motion. Dr. Zach will coordinate timing with your releasing provider.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the adjustment safe for a newborn?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Dr. Zach uses incredibly gentle techniques designed specifically for infants. The pressure is lighter than what you\'d use to test a ripe tomato. There is no cracking or forceful manipulation. Parents stay with their baby throughout, and babies often sleep through their adjustments.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if my baby has a tongue tie?',
      answer:
        'A qualified lactation consultant (IBCLC) or pediatric dentist trained in tethered oral tissues is the best resource for diagnosis. Signs include painful latch, clicking during feeding, poor weight gain, excessive gas/reflux, and milk leaking from the mouth. Dr. Zach can also screen for these signs and refer you appropriately.',
