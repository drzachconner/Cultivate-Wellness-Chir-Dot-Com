  intro: [
    'When your child isn\'t meeting developmental milestones on time, it can be an anxious and confusing experience. At Cultivate Wellness, we support children with developmental delays by optimizing the nervous system that drives every aspect of growth -- from rolling over and crawling to walking, talking, and social engagement.',
    'Developmental delays can involve motor skills, speech and language, cognitive abilities, or social-emotional development. While chiropractic care does not treat developmental delays directly, it addresses nervous system interference that may be limiting your child\'s ability to reach their full potential. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach works alongside your child\'s medical team, therapists, and specialists.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care cure developmental delays?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not cure developmental delays. What it does is optimize nervous system function, removing interference that may be limiting your child\'s ability to develop. Many parents report that their children make faster progress in other therapies and begin reaching milestones after starting chiropractic care.',

      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for children with developmental delays?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Dr. Zach uses extraordinarily gentle techniques that are adapted to each child\'s age, size, and needs. There is no cracking or forceful manipulation. The techniques we use are safe for children of all ages and developmental levels.',

    {
      question: 'How does a spinal misalignment affect development?',
      answer:
        'The nervous system controls and coordinates every function in the body, including development. When spinal misalignments create interference in nerve signaling -- particularly in the upper cervical spine near the brainstem -- it can affect motor control, sensory processing, autonomic regulation, and brain-body communication.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will chiropractic care replace my child\'s other therapies?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care complements and supports the work being done by your child\'s occupational therapist, speech therapist, physical therapist, and other providers. Many therapists report that their patients make faster progress when receiving concurrent chiropractic care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits before we see improvement?',
      answer:
        'Every child responds differently. Some parents notice changes within the first few visits, while others see gradual improvement over weeks. Dr. Zach performs regular evaluations and adjusts the care plan based on your child\'s progress.',
