  intro: [
    'Is your baby\'s head always tilted to one side? Do they have trouble turning their head both ways? Your baby may have torticollis -- a common condition that responds remarkably well to gentle chiropractic care. At Cultivate Wellness, we specialize in helping infants with torticollis using extremely gentle techniques.',
    'Torticollis (also called "wry neck") is a condition where a baby\'s neck muscles are tight or shortened on one side, causing the head to tilt in one direction while the chin points the other way. It is one of the most common musculoskeletal conditions in infants, often caused by birth trauma, in-utero positioning, breech presentation, or C-section delivery.',

      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for my baby\'s torticollis?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our doctors use incredibly gentle techniques designed specifically for infants. The pressure is about what you\'d use to check a ripe tomato -- lighter than light. There is no cracking or popping. Babies often fall asleep during their adjustments. Parents are with their baby the entire time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What causes torticollis?',
      answer:
        'Torticollis is commonly caused by birth trauma (difficult delivery, vacuum or forceps use, prolonged labor), in-utero positioning (cramped quarters), breech presentation, multiple births, and C-section delivery. Any of these can create tightness or misalignment in the upper cervical spine.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is chiropractic different from stretching exercises?',
      answer:
        'Stretching exercises address the muscle tightness but not the underlying cause. In many cases, the muscle is tight because there is a spinal misalignment causing it to guard. Chiropractic addresses that root cause, which is why it often works faster and more completely. The two approaches work well together.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will my baby need?',
      answer:
        'Most babies show significant improvement within 4-8 visits, typically scheduled 1-2 times per week initially. Our team will monitor progress and adjust the care plan based on your baby\'s response.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What other issues can torticollis cause?',
      answer:
        'Left untreated, torticollis can lead to plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome), breastfeeding difficulties and latch issues, colic and fussiness, reflux, sleep difficulties, and developmental delays. Early intervention is key to preventing these secondary issues.',
