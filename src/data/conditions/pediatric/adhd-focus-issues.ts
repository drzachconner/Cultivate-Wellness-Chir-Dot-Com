  intro: [
    'Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects millions of children and adults, impacting their ability to focus, regulate emotions, and navigate daily life. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer a drug-free, neurologically-focused approach that addresses the underlying nervous system factors contributing to attention and focus challenges.',
    'ADHD is fundamentally a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes information, regulates attention, and controls impulses. Research shows that individuals with ADHD often have a dysregulated autonomic nervous system, altered brain wave patterns, impaired prefrontal cortex function, and sensory processing differences. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach supports better nervous system function by removing interference and improving brain-body communication.',

      question: 'Does chiropractic care cure ADHD?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not treat or cure ADHD as a disease. What it does is optimize nervous system function, removing interference that may be contributing to symptoms like poor focus, hyperactivity, and emotional dysregulation. Many families see meaningful improvements when the nervous system is functioning at its best.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is chiropractic care safe for children with ADHD?',
      answer:
        'Yes. We use extremely gentle techniques that are specifically adapted for children. There is no cracking or forceful manipulation. The adjustments are so light that many children find them relaxing and enjoyable.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my child continue taking ADHD medication while under chiropractic care?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Chiropractic care is complementary to any existing treatments your child is receiving, including medication. We encourage you to work with your prescribing physician regarding any medication decisions. Many families find that as nervous system function improves, they can discuss medication adjustments with their doctor.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will my child need before seeing improvement?',
      answer:
        'Every child is different, so we don\'t discuss specific visit frequency or timelines until we\'ve completed a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans. This allows our team to develop a care plan tailored to your child\'s unique neurological needs. We perform regular progress evaluations and adjust the plan based on your child\'s response.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with adults who have ADHD?',
      answer:
        'Yes. ADHD doesn\'t just affect children. Many adults struggle with focus, time management, organization, and impulsive decisions. Adults can benefit from the same neurologically-focused chiropractic care we provide to children.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect at the first visit?',
      answer:
        'The first visit includes a comprehensive consultation where we will review your child\'s history, concerns, and goals. This is followed by a neurological evaluation including scanning technology to objectively measure nervous system function. Our team will then explain the findings and recommend a personalized care plan.',
