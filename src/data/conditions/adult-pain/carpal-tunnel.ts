    'If you\'re experiencing numbness, tingling, or pain in your hand and wrist, you may have been told you have carpal tunnel syndrome. Before considering surgery, discover how chiropractic care can often provide significant relief by addressing nerve interference throughout the entire pathway, not just at the wrist.',
    'Research has shown that many cases of "carpal tunnel syndrome" actually involve nerve compression at multiple points, a concept called "double crush syndrome." The median nerve travels from your neck, through your shoulder, down your arm, through your elbow, and finally through the carpal tunnel in your wrist. Compression at ANY point along this path can cause symptoms, which is why wrist surgery sometimes fails.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic really help carpal tunnel syndrome?',
      answer:
        'Yes. By addressing nerve compression along the entire median nerve pathway, from neck to wrist, chiropractic care often provides significant relief. Many cases of carpal tunnel involve compression at multiple points (double crush syndrome), and addressing only the wrist misses the bigger picture.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do you focus on the neck for a wrist problem?',
      answer:
        'The median nerve that causes carpal tunnel symptoms originates in the cervical spine. Neurological tension in the neck can compress these nerve roots, making the nerve more susceptible to irritation downstream. Reducing cervical neurological tension often produces dramatic improvement in hand symptoms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I try chiropractic before surgery?',
      answer:
        'In most cases, yes. Conservative care should be attempted before considering surgical intervention. Many patients find complete relief through chiropractic care without surgery. If your condition requires surgical consultation, we will refer you appropriately.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help if I\'ve already had surgery but still have symptoms?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Post-surgical patients who still have symptoms often benefit from chiropractic care. If the nerve was compressed at additional sites beyond the carpal tunnel, surgery at the wrist alone may not fully resolve symptoms. We can evaluate and address remaining compression points.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will I need?',
      answer:
        'This varies based on the severity and duration of your symptoms and how many compression sites are involved. Many patients notice improvement within the first few visits. Our team will create a personalized care plan and monitor your progress closely.',
