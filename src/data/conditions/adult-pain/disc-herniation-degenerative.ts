  intro: [
    'Disc herniations and degenerative disc disease are among the most common causes of back pain, neck pain, and radiating nerve symptoms. At Cultivate Wellness, we help patients with disc problems find relief and improve function using gentle, conservative care that avoids the risks of surgery and the cycle of pain medication.',
    'Spinal discs act as shock absorbers between your vertebrae. A herniation occurs when the soft inner material pushes through the outer wall, potentially compressing nearby nerves. Degenerative disc disease involves the gradual breakdown of disc structure over time. Both conditions respond well to our gentle, neurologically-focused approach, which reduces pressure on discs and nerves without forceful manipulation.',

      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for a herniated disc?',
      answer:
        'Yes -- our gentle approach is specifically designed for disc conditions. Unlike forceful manipulation, our neurologically-focused techniques use light, precise contact that reduces disc pressure without risk of worsening the herniation. We always evaluate thoroughly before beginning care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can a herniated disc heal without surgery?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Research shows that most disc herniations improve with conservative care. The body can naturally reabsorb herniated disc material over time, and chiropractic care supports this process by reducing pressure on the disc and optimizing spinal mechanics.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the difference between a bulging disc and a herniated disc?',
      answer:
        'A bulging disc is when the disc expands beyond its normal boundary but the outer wall is intact. A herniation is when the inner material pushes through a tear in the outer wall. Both can cause symptoms if they compress nerves, and both can benefit from our gentle approach.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can degenerative disc disease be reversed?',
      answer:
        'Disc degeneration itself is a natural part of aging and cannot be fully reversed. However, the symptoms of degenerative disc disease -- pain, stiffness, nerve compression -- can often be significantly improved. Proper spinal alignment and movement help manage the condition and slow further progression.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will I need?',
      answer:
        'Disc conditions vary widely in severity. Mild cases may improve in a few weeks, while more significant herniations may require several months of care. Our team will give you a realistic assessment and track your progress at regular intervals.',
