  intro: [
    'If you spend hours hunched over a computer, looking down at your phone, or sitting at a desk, you\'re not alone -- and your spine is paying the price. "Tech neck," forward head posture, and rounded shoulders have become epidemic. At Cultivate Wellness, we help reverse these postural problems before they cause permanent damage.',
    'For every inch your head moves forward, it effectively weighs an additional 10 pounds on your neck. A normal head weighs 10-12 pounds, but at a 60-degree angle (common when texting), it\'s like carrying 60 pounds on your neck. Over time, this creates structural changes, nerve damage, and chronic pain that gets progressively worse without intervention.',

      question: 'Can tech neck really be reversed?',
      answer:
        'Yes, especially when caught early. Chiropractic adjustments combined with exercises and ergonomic changes can restore proper cervical curvature and alignment. The longer poor posture has been present, the longer correction may take, but significant improvement is possible at any stage. The key is starting before permanent degenerative changes set in.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does posture correction take?',
      answer:
        'This depends on the severity and duration of your postural problems. Most patients see noticeable improvement within the first few weeks. Full correction of long-standing postural issues may take several months of consistent care combined with daily exercises. Dr. Zach will create a realistic timeline based on your evaluation.',

    {
      question: 'Can you help children with tech neck?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. With children spending increasing time on devices, pediatric tech neck is a growing concern. The good news is that children\'s spines respond more quickly to correction than adults. Our gentle techniques are perfectly suited for children, and early intervention can prevent lifelong spinal problems.',

    {
      question: 'Do I need to stop using my phone and computer?',
      answer:
        'No, but you\'ll need to change HOW you use them. We provide specific ergonomic recommendations: raising your phone to eye level, positioning your monitor at proper height, taking breaks every 30 minutes, and setting up an ergonomic workstation. Small changes in habits make a big difference.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I don\'t correct my posture?',
      answer:
        'Left uncorrected, postural problems progressively worsen and can lead to degenerative disc disease, arthritis in the neck and back, permanent spinal changes, chronic headaches, reduced lung capacity, nerve damage, TMJ problems, and significantly reduced quality of life.',
