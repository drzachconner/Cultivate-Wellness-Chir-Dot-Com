    'Spinal stenosis, the narrowing of the spinal canal that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves, can cause pain, numbness, and difficulty walking that significantly impacts your quality of life. At Cultivate Wellness, we help patients with spinal stenosis manage their symptoms and improve function using gentle, conservative care.',
    'While chiropractic care cannot reverse the structural narrowing of the spinal canal, it can significantly reduce symptoms by optimizing spinal alignment, reducing inflammation, and improving the way your spine moves. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach is especially well-suited for stenosis patients because it avoids forceful manipulation that could aggravate the condition.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure spinal stenosis?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care cannot reverse the structural narrowing of the spinal canal. However, it can significantly reduce symptoms by optimizing spinal alignment, improving mobility, and reducing nerve pressure. Many patients experience substantial improvement in function and quality of life.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it safe to adjust someone with spinal stenosis?',
      answer:
        'Yes, with the right approach. Forceful manipulation is not appropriate for stenosis. Our gentle, neurologically-focused techniques use light, precise contact specifically suited for this condition. We evaluate each patient thoroughly and adapt care to their specific situation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I need surgery for spinal stenosis?',
      answer:
        'Most cases of spinal stenosis can be managed conservatively. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases with progressive weakness, loss of bladder/bowel control, or failure to respond to conservative care. We will give you an honest assessment and refer you if surgical consultation is appropriate.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often will I need to come in?',
      answer:
        'Since spinal stenosis is a chronic, degenerative condition, ongoing care is often beneficial. We determine the right approach and frequency after completing a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans. This allows our team to develop a management plan based on your specific needs and response to care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does spinal stenosis always get worse?',
      answer:
        'Not necessarily. While the structural narrowing may gradually progress, symptoms can often be managed effectively with proper care. Maintaining good spinal alignment, staying active, and addressing flare-ups promptly can help you maintain your quality of life for years.',
