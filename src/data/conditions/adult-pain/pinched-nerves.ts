  intro: [
    'A pinched nerve can cause sharp pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness that disrupts your daily life. Whether it\'s in your neck, back, or extremities, the underlying cause is often the same: neurological tension or a structural issue compressing or irritating a nerve. At Cultivate Wellness, we address the root cause of nerve compression using gentle, neurologically-focused techniques.',
    'Pinched nerves (also called nerve compression or radiculopathy) occur when surrounding structures, such as vertebrae, discs, muscles, or ligaments, put excessive pressure on a nerve. This pressure disrupts the nerve\'s normal function, causing pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the areas that nerve supplies. Our gentle approach reduces this pressure without forceful manipulation, helping restore normal nerve function.',

      question: 'How do I know if I have a pinched nerve?',
      answer:
        'Common signs include sharp or shooting pain that radiates down an arm or leg, numbness or tingling in a specific pattern, muscle weakness, and symptoms that change with neck or back position. Our doctors can perform specific neurological tests to determine whether a pinched nerve is causing your symptoms.',

    {
      question: 'Is it safe to adjust a pinched nerve?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our gentle approach is specifically designed for sensitive situations. Unlike forceful manipulation that could aggravate nerve compression, our neurologically-focused techniques use light, precise contact to reduce pressure on the nerve without adding stress.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a pinched nerve take to heal?',
      answer:
        'The timeline depends on many factors, including the cause and severity of compression, how long the nerve has been compressed, and your overall health. We don\'t provide specific estimates until after a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans, which give our team the information needed to develop a care plan tailored to your specific findings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can a pinched nerve heal on its own?',
      answer:
        'Some mild cases may improve with rest and time. However, if the underlying cause (neurological tension, disc issue) isn\'t addressed, the nerve compression often returns or worsens. Addressing the root cause provides more lasting relief.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I consider surgery for a pinched nerve?',
      answer:
        'Surgery is typically a last resort. Signs that may indicate the need for surgical consultation include progressive muscle weakness, loss of bladder or bowel control, or failure to respond to conservative care. We will always refer appropriately if your condition requires medical intervention.',
