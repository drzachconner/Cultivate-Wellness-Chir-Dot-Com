    'Vertigo and dizziness can be disabling, making it impossible to work, drive, or even walk safely. If you\'ve been told there\'s nothing wrong or given medications that don\'t help, you haven\'t explored all your options. Many cases of vertigo and dizziness have a cervical (neck) component that responds remarkably well to chiropractic care.',
    'Your brain uses three systems to maintain balance: visual (what your eyes see), vestibular (inner ear balance organs), and proprioceptive (position sensors, especially in your neck). The upper cervical spine contains more proprioceptors than anywhere else in the body. When there\'s neurological tension here, the brain receives conflicting signals about body position, resulting in dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance.',

      question: 'How can a chiropractor help with vertigo?',
      answer:
        'The upper cervical spine contains more proprioceptors (position sensors) than anywhere else in your body. When there\'s neurological tension in this area, the brain receives conflicting signals about body position, causing dizziness and vertigo. By reducing cervical neurological tension, we restore accurate proprioceptive signaling and help resolve the balance confusion.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if my vertigo is cervicogenic (neck-related)?',
      answer:
        'Signs that your vertigo may have a cervical component include: dizziness triggered by neck movement, neck pain or stiffness along with vertigo, history of neck injury or whiplash, ENT or neurologist found nothing wrong, medications haven\'t helped, symptoms that vary with neck position, or symptoms that worsen after looking at screens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the adjustment make me more dizzy?',
      answer:
        'Our gentle techniques are specifically suited for vertigo patients. Most patients feel improvement quickly, sometimes the same day. Some may experience a temporary, mild increase in symptoms as the body adjusts to the new alignment, but this typically resolves quickly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help with BPPV?',
      answer:
        'Yes. For benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), we can perform the Epley maneuver and other repositioning techniques to move displaced crystals in the inner ear. We often combine this with cervical correction for comprehensive vertigo treatment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits will I need?',
      answer:
        'Many patients feel improvement quickly, sometimes after the first visit. Most cases see significant improvement within 4-8 weeks. Long-standing cases may take longer. Our team will perform regular reassessments and adjust your care plan based on your progress.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I see an ENT first?',
      answer:
        'It\'s wise to have a medical evaluation to rule out serious conditions. However, if your ENT or neurologist has found nothing wrong or medications haven\'t helped, it\'s very likely there\'s a cervical component. We\'re happy to work alongside your medical team for comprehensive care.',
