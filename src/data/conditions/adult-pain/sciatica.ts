    'Sciatica can be debilitating. That shooting pain down your leg that makes it hard to sit, stand, walk, or sleep. At Cultivate Wellness, we\'ve helped many patients find lasting relief from sciatica without drugs or surgery, using gentle techniques that address the root cause of your pain.',
    'Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, the longest nerve in your body. It runs from your lower back through your hips and buttocks, then down each leg. Sciatica typically affects only one side of your body and can range from a mild ache to sharp, burning pain or even debilitating discomfort that makes daily activities nearly impossible.',

      question: 'What causes sciatica?',
      answer:
        'The most common causes include herniated or bulging discs pressing on the sciatic nerve, spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), neurological tension irritating the nerve roots, and piriformis syndrome (the piriformis muscle in the buttock spasming and irritating the sciatic nerve).',

This evaluation helps our team understand the root cause of your sciatica and develop a care plan tailored to your needs.
