  intro: [
    'Sciatica can be debilitating -- that shooting pain down your leg that makes it hard to sit, stand, walk, or sleep. At Cultivate Wellness, we\'ve helped many patients find lasting relief from sciatica without drugs or surgery, using gentle techniques that address the root cause of your pain.',
    'Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve -- the longest nerve in your body. It runs from your lower back through your hips and buttocks, then down each leg. Sciatica typically affects only one side of your body and can range from a mild ache to sharp, burning pain or even debilitating discomfort that makes daily activities nearly impossible.',

      question: 'What causes sciatica?',
      answer:
        'The most common causes include herniated or bulging discs pressing on the sciatic nerve, spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), subluxation (vertebral misalignment) irritating the nerve roots, and piriformis syndrome (the piriformis muscle in the buttock spasming and irritating the sciatic nerve).',

      question: 'How quickly will I feel better?',
      answer:
        'Many patients feel improvement after their first visit. Most sciatica cases respond well within 4-8 weeks of care. Our gentle techniques mean no additional pain or discomfort during treatment. However, every case is different and Dr. Zach will give you an honest assessment of your expected timeline.',

    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic help avoid surgery?',
      answer:
        'In many cases, yes. Conservative care like chiropractic should always be tried before considering surgical intervention. Many patients who were told they needed surgery have found lasting relief through chiropractic care. However, some cases do require surgical consultation, and we will refer you if appropriate.',

    {
      question: 'What if I\'ve had sciatica for years?',
      answer:
        'Whether your sciatica is new or you\'ve been suffering for years, we can help. Long-standing cases may take longer to resolve, but our gentle approach has helped many chronic sciatica sufferers return to pain-free living. It\'s never too late to address the underlying cause.',
