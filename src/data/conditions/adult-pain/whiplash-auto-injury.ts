  intro: [
    'A car accident can change your life in seconds. Even a low-speed collision can cause significant injury to the spine, muscles, and nervous system -- and symptoms often don\'t appear until days or weeks later. At Cultivate Wellness, we specialize in helping auto accident patients recover fully using gentle, neurologically-focused chiropractic care.',
    'Whiplash occurs when the head is suddenly thrown forward and backward (or side to side), damaging the delicate structures of the cervical spine. This rapid motion can misalign vertebrae, strain ligaments and muscles, irritate nerves, and create inflammation that leads to pain, stiffness, headaches, and a host of other symptoms. Our gentle approach addresses the underlying spinal injuries without adding more stress to an already traumatized body.',

      question: 'How soon after an accident should I come in?',
      answer:
        'As soon as possible. Many whiplash symptoms are delayed, and early intervention produces the best outcomes. Ideally, get evaluated within the first week after an accident, even if you feel "fine." Early care can prevent acute injuries from becoming chronic problems.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I was only in a minor fender-bender. Do I still need care?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Research shows that injuries can occur at collision speeds as low as 5 mph. A low-speed impact can still cause significant damage to the cervical spine, especially if your head was turned at the time of impact. Don\'t assume you\'re fine because the car wasn\'t badly damaged.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is your approach safe after an accident?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach is specifically suited for injured patients. Unlike traditional chiropractic that uses forceful manipulation (which is contraindicated after acute trauma), our techniques use light, precise contact that doesn\'t add stress to damaged tissues.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with auto insurance?',
      answer:
        'Yes. We provide thorough documentation and can work with auto insurance claims. Michigan\'s no-fault auto insurance covers chiropractic care for accident injuries. We can help you navigate the process.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does recovery from whiplash take?',
      answer:
        'Recovery time varies based on the severity of injury, how quickly you begin care, and your individual health factors. Mild cases may resolve in a few weeks, while more severe injuries may take several months. Dr. Zach will give you an honest assessment and track your progress throughout care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can old accident injuries still be helped?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Even if your accident was months or years ago, chiropractic care can help address lingering misalignments and chronic problems that developed after the initial injury. It\'s never too late to address the underlying cause of persistent post-accident symptoms.',
