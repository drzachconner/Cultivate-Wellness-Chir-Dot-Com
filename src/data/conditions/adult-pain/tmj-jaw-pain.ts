    'Do you suffer from jaw pain, clicking, popping, or difficulty opening your mouth? TMJ disorders affect millions of people and can cause debilitating pain that impacts eating, speaking, and quality of life. At Cultivate Wellness, we address TMJ issues by treating the often-overlooked connection between your jaw and your cervical spine.',
    'TMJ problems rarely exist in isolation. The upper cervical spine and jaw are intimately connected through shared nerve supply, muscle connections, postural relationships, and compensation patterns. The trigeminal nerve affects both areas, and neck muscles attach directly to jaw structures. Treating one without addressing the other often leads to incomplete results.',

      question: 'Why does my chiropractor need to look at my neck for jaw pain?',
      answer:
        'The TMJ and upper cervical spine share nerve supply (trigeminal nerve), muscle connections, and postural relationships. When the cervical neurology is under tension, it affects head position, which changes how your jaw comes together. This creates muscle imbalance and joint stress. Addressing the neck is often essential for lasting TMJ relief.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will I see results?',
      answer:
        'Most patients notice improvement within 4-6 visits. Some experience relief after their first adjustment, especially when cervical correction improves jaw alignment. Chronic TMJ cases may take longer, but our team will track your progress and adjust the plan accordingly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the treatment painful?',
      answer:
        'No. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach is very comfortable. There is no forceful manipulation, cracking, or sudden movements. Even the TMJ-specific work is gentle. Most patients find the treatment relaxing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I still see my dentist for TMJ?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Chiropractic care and dental care for TMJ complement each other. Night guards address teeth grinding while chiropractic corrects the spinal and structural factors contributing to TMJ dysfunction. We are happy to coordinate with your dentist for optimal results.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What causes TMJ problems?',
      answer:
        'Common causes include cervical neurological tension, trauma to the jaw or head, whiplash injuries, teeth grinding (bruxism), stress and muscle tension, poor posture (forward head position), dental work or bite changes, and arthritis in the jaw joint. We evaluate all potential contributors during your examination.',
