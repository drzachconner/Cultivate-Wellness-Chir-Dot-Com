    'Headaches and migraines can be debilitating, affecting your work, relationships, and quality of life. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer a natural, drug-free approach that addresses the underlying causes of head pain rather than just masking symptoms with medication.',
    'Research shows that up to 95% of headaches are primary headaches, meaning they aren\'t caused by disease but by dysfunction in the neck, muscles, or nervous system. This is exactly what chiropractic care addresses. The upper cervical spine (C1-C2) is intimately connected to head pain through blood flow, nerve supply, and brainstem proximity, and our neurologically-focused approach targets these critical connections.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic really help with migraines?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Migraines are a neurological condition, and our neurologically-focused approach is particularly well-suited for them. By addressing nervous system interference, upper cervical neurological tension, and trigger sensitivity, many migraine sufferers who haven\'t found relief elsewhere discover significant improvement with chiropractic care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will I see results?',
      answer:
        'Every patient is different, so we don\'t predict specific timelines until we\'ve completed a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans. This initial evaluation allows our team to understand the neurological root of your headaches and create a personalized care plan. Chronic headache sufferers may need more time, and we track your progress and adjust the plan accordingly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can children receive chiropractic care for headaches?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Children suffer from headaches too, often from birth trauma, heavy backpacks, screen time, and stress. Our gentle techniques are perfectly suited for children. Our doctors have specialized training in pediatric care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I stop my headache medications?',
      answer:
        'Never stop medications without consulting your prescribing physician. Many patients find that as headache frequency decreases with chiropractic care, they can work with their doctor to reduce medication use. We encourage collaborative care with your medical team.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When should I seek emergency care instead?',
      answer:
        'Seek immediate medical attention for headaches that are sudden and severe ("worst headache of your life"), accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, or following a head injury. These may indicate a serious medical condition requiring emergency care.',
