  intro: [
    'Seizure disorders, including epilepsy, are neurological conditions characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer gentle, supportive care that focuses on optimizing nervous system function -- a complementary approach that many families find helpful alongside their medical treatment.',
    'The premise behind chiropractic support for seizure disorders is straightforward: the spine protects the spinal cord, a direct extension of the brain, and spinal misalignments can affect nerve function and potentially influence neurological activity. Improved nervous system communication may support overall neurological health, and reducing physical stress on the nervous system may help lower seizure thresholds for some patients.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care cure epilepsy or seizure disorders?',
      answer:
        'No. We want to be completely transparent: chiropractic care is not a cure for epilepsy or seizure disorders. Some patients see significant improvements in seizure control, others notice modest benefits, and some may not see changes in seizure activity but benefit from improved overall wellbeing. What we offer is a safe, gentle, drug-free approach that supports nervous system health.',

    {
      question: 'Should I stop my seizure medication to try chiropractic?',
      answer:

      question: 'Do you work with children who have seizures?',
