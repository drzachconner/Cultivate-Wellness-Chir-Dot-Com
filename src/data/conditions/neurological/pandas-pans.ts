  intro: [
    'PANDAS and PANS are conditions where the body\'s immune response triggers sudden, dramatic neuropsychiatric symptoms in children. These conditions can be frightening for families, and finding effective support is crucial. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer gentle, nervous system-focused care that can support children dealing with these challenging conditions alongside their medical treatment.',
    'PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections) involves sudden onset of OCD and/or tics following a strep infection, caused by an autoimmune response that affects the brain. PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) is a broader category that includes sudden neuropsychiatric symptoms triggered by various infections or environmental factors, not just strep.',

      question: 'Does chiropractic care treat PANDAS or PANS?',
