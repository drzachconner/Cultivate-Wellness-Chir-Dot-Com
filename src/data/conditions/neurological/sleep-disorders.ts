      question: 'How can a chiropractor help with sleep?',
      answer:
        'Sleep requires your nervous system to shift into parasympathetic (rest) mode. Neurological tension, especially in the upper cervical area, can keep your nervous system stuck in sympathetic (fight or flight) mode. By reducing nervous system interference and restoring proper function, chiropractic care supports your body\'s natural ability to relax into deep, restorative sleep.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic help my child sleep better?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Sleep problems in children are increasingly common, and chiropractic can help. Birth trauma and childhood falls can create neurological tension patterns that affect sleep regulation. Our gentle techniques often produce remarkable improvements in children\'s sleep, from infants who won\'t settle to teens with disrupted sleep patterns.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will I see sleep improvements?',
      answer:
        'Because every person\'s situation is unique, we don\'t predict specific timelines until we\'ve completed a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans. This allows our team to understand the factors affecting your sleep and develop a care plan tailored to your needs. Chronic sleep problems may take longer to fully resolve as the nervous system rebalances. We track your progress and adjust care accordingly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I stop taking sleep medications?',
      answer:
        'Never stop medications without consulting your prescribing physician. Many patients find that as their sleep naturally improves through chiropractic care, they can discuss reducing sleep medications with their doctor. We encourage you to work with your medical team regarding any medication decisions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about sleep apnea?',
      answer:
        'Sleep apnea and other serious sleep disorders require medical evaluation and treatment. Chiropractic care can be a valuable complement to medical treatment for sleep apnea, but should not replace diagnosis and care of serious sleep conditions. We\'re happy to work alongside your sleep specialist.',
