  intro: [
    'POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and other forms of dysautonomia affect the autonomic nervous system -- the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and temperature regulation. At Cultivate Wellness, we offer supportive care that addresses the underlying nervous system dysfunction contributing to these challenging conditions.',
    'Dysautonomia is an umbrella term for conditions involving dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls vital automatic body functions including heart rate and blood pressure regulation, breathing, digestion, temperature regulation, sleep-wake cycles, and more. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach helps support healthier autonomic function.',

      question: 'How does the spine affect the autonomic nervous system?',
      answer:
        'The autonomic nervous system is intimately connected to the spine. The brainstem (ANS control center) sits at the base of the skull, the vagus nerve passes through the upper cervical spine, the sympathetic chain runs alongside the thoracic spine, and sacral nerves contribute to parasympathetic function. Spinal misalignments can interfere with all of these structures.',

    {
      question: 'What types of dysautonomia do you see?',
      answer:
        'We support patients with POTS, neurocardiogenic syncope, orthostatic hypotension, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, autonomic neuropathy, post-viral dysautonomia (including Long COVID), EDS-related dysautonomia, and mast cell activation-related dysautonomia.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the adjustments trigger my POTS symptoms?',
      answer:
        'We take every precaution to avoid triggering symptoms. We can adjust you lying down, use no sudden movements, and proceed gently. Our techniques are specifically chosen to calm the nervous system rather than activate it. Most POTS patients tolerate our gentle approach well.',

      question: 'Do you work with cardiologists and other specialists?',

        'Yes. We believe in collaborative care and are happy to communicate with your cardiologist, neurologist, or other specialists. Chiropractic care is one supportive component of comprehensive dysautonomia management.',

      question: 'How long does it take to see improvement?',

        'Every patient is different. Some notice improvements within the first few weeks, while others take longer. Dysautonomia is a complex condition, and improvement is often gradual. Dr. Zach uses objective HRV testing to track your progress and adjust your care plan accordingly.',
