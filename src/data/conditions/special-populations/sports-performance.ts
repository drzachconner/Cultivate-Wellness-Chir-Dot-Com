      question: 'Do professional athletes really use chiropractors?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Nearly all professional sports teams have chiropractors on staff or on call. Many elite athletes credit chiropractic care as a key part of their performance and recovery routine. If it works at the highest levels of sport, imagine what it can do for your game.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care help my child who plays sports?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Young athletes face unique challenges as their bodies grow while under athletic demands. Our gentle techniques are perfect for youth athletes of any age, supporting proper development, preventing overuse injuries, and optimizing performance.',

      question: 'Should I come in before or after a big game?',
      answer:
        'Both can be beneficial. Pre-game adjustments help ensure your body is functioning at peak capacity. Post-game care supports faster recovery and addresses any issues from competition. Many athletes incorporate chiropractic care into their regular training schedule.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help with an injury I already have?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our care helps injured athletes recover faster and return to their sport safely. Better nerve function supports faster tissue repair, and we provide drug-free pain relief. We work alongside physical therapists and other rehabilitation providers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is your approach different from a sports chiropractor who does cracking?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach delivers precise corrections without cracking or forceful manipulation. This is actually advantageous for athletes because it does not create the muscle guarding response that traditional adjustments can trigger, leading to more effective and longer-lasting corrections.',
