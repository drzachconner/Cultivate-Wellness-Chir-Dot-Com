    {
      question: 'How does chiropractic help with balance?',
      answer:
        'Chiropractic care improves proprioception -- your body\'s awareness of its position in space. The spine contains a dense network of sensors that communicate balance information to the brain. When spinal function improves, so does the quality of this information, leading to better balance and reduced fall risk.',
