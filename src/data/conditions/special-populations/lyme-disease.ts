      question: 'Can chiropractic care cure Lyme disease?',
      answer:

Chiropractic care is a supportive therapy that optimizes nervous system function, helping your body heal more effectively alongside your medical treatment.',

      question: 'Will adjustments trigger a Herxheimer reaction?',
      answer:
        'Chiropractic adjustments are not known to directly cause Herxheimer reactions, as those are triggered by die-off of Lyme bacteria. However, we are aware of herx reactions and work around your treatment cycles. We go slowly and adjust our intensity based on how you are feeling.',

These improvements support your body\'s overall healing process.',
