  intro: [
    'A concussion is more than just a bump on the head -- it\'s a traumatic brain injury that can cause symptoms lasting weeks, months, or even years. At Cultivate Wellness, we support concussion and post-concussion syndrome (PCS) recovery by addressing the cervical spine injuries and nervous system dysfunction that almost always accompany head trauma.',
    'Any force strong enough to cause a concussion is also strong enough to misalign the upper cervical spine. Research increasingly shows that many persistent post-concussion symptoms -- headaches, dizziness, brain fog, neck pain -- are actually driven by cervical spine injury rather than the brain injury alone. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses this often-overlooked component of concussion recovery.',

      question: 'Is it safe to see a chiropractor after a concussion?',
      answer:
        'Yes -- with the right approach. Our gentle, neurologically-focused techniques are specifically safe for post-concussion patients. We never use forceful manipulation, and we adapt our care to your sensitivity level. We recommend being evaluated by a physician first to rule out more serious injury.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How soon after a concussion can I start care?',
      answer:
        'After you\'ve been medically evaluated to rule out more serious injury (bleeding, fracture), gentle chiropractic care can begin. Many providers recommend addressing the cervical component early, as it can significantly improve recovery trajectory.',
    },
    {
      question: 'My concussion was months ago and I still have symptoms. Can you help?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Post-concussion syndrome (symptoms lasting beyond the typical recovery period) often has a significant cervical spine component that was never addressed. Many patients with persistent symptoms improve significantly with upper cervical chiropractic care, even months or years after their injury.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you treat the brain injury itself?',
      answer:
        'No. We do not treat the brain injury directly. We address the cervical spine injuries and nervous system dysfunction that accompany concussion and that contribute to many persistent symptoms. This is a complementary approach that works alongside your neurological care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic help with sports-related concussions?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Sports concussions nearly always involve cervical spine trauma from the same impact. Addressing this cervical component can significantly speed recovery and support a safer return to play. We work with your athletic trainer and physician on return-to-sport protocols.',
