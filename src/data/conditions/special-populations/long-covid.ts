  intro: [
    'If you\'re dealing with persistent symptoms months after a COVID-19 infection or other viral illness -- fatigue, brain fog, heart palpitations, and more -- you\'re not alone, and you\'re not imagining it. At Cultivate Wellness, we support patients with long COVID and post-viral syndromes by addressing the nervous system dysfunction that plays a central role in these conditions.',
    'Long COVID and other post-viral syndromes share a common feature: dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve, which regulates heart rate, breathing, digestion, and immune function, often becomes dysfunctional following viral infection. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach supports autonomic recovery and helps your body find its way back to balance.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure long COVID?',
      answer:
        'No. There is currently no cure for long COVID. Chiropractic care supports the nervous system function that is disrupted in long COVID, particularly autonomic regulation. By addressing this dysfunction, many patients experience meaningful improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.',

      question: 'Is chiropractic safe for long COVID patients?',

        'Yes. Our gentle approach is specifically suited for the heightened sensitivity of post-viral patients. We start conservatively and adjust intensity based on your response. There is no cracking, no forceful manipulation, and we pace care to avoid triggering symptom flares.',

      question: 'Will my symptoms come back if I stop chiropractic care?',

    {
      question: 'How does this differ from other long COVID treatments?',
      answer:
        'Most long COVID treatments address individual symptoms (medications for fatigue, heart rate, pain). Our approach addresses the underlying autonomic nervous system dysfunction driving many of these symptoms simultaneously. Chiropractic care complements other treatments and is not a replacement for medical care.',
