  intro: [
    'Scoliosis, an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine often with rotation, affects millions of people. Whether you are a parent who just learned your child has scoliosis, a teen dealing with the condition, or an adult managing long-term scoliosis, chiropractic care can help improve function, reduce pain, and in some cases help slow curve progression.',
    'Scoliosis is most effectively managed when caught early, especially in growing children. At Cultivate Wellness, our gentle, neurologically-focused approach provides safe, comfortable care for scoliosis patients of all ages, from adolescents experiencing growth spurts to adults managing degenerative changes.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care straighten a scoliotic spine?',
      answer:
        'While we cannot fully straighten a scoliotic spine, we can often improve function, reduce pain, and help maintain the best possible quality of life. For growing children, early intervention may help influence curve development and potentially slow progression during critical growth periods.',

    {
      question: 'What types of scoliosis do you see?',
      answer:
        'We work with all types: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (the most common type, appearing during growth spurts), congenital scoliosis (present at birth), neuromuscular scoliosis (secondary to conditions like cerebral palsy), and degenerative adult scoliosis (developing from disc degeneration and arthritis).',

    {
      question: 'Is your approach safe for growing children?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach is specifically safe for growing spines. There is no cracking, twisting, or forceful manipulation. We monitor curve progression carefully during growth spurts and coordinate with pediatricians and orthopedic specialists as needed.',
    },
    {
      question: 'My child was told to "watch and wait." Can you do more?',
      answer:
        'While monitoring is important, active conservative care can support spinal health during the watching period. Gentle chiropractic adjustments, combined with appropriate exercises, can help improve spinal mobility and function. We always coordinate with your child\'s orthopedist regarding the overall management plan.',

    {
      question: 'Do you work with patients who have had scoliosis surgery?',
      answer:
        'Yes. We can provide supportive care for post-surgical scoliosis patients, working around hardware and fused segments to optimize function in the mobile areas of the spine. We also help manage associated conditions like stenosis and disc issues.',

    {
      question: 'Does scoliosis care differ for adults vs. children?',
      answer:
        'Yes. For children and adolescents, the focus is on monitoring progression during growth, supporting proper development, and potentially slowing curve increase. For adults, care focuses on pain management, maintaining mobility, preventing further degeneration, and improving quality of life.',
