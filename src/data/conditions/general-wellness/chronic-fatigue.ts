  intro: [
    'Are you exhausted all the time, no matter how much you sleep? Does even simple activity leave you drained? Chronic fatigue can steal your quality of life, making it hard to work, care for your family, or enjoy anything. While there is no simple fix, chiropractic care addresses a frequently overlooked piece of the puzzle: nervous system function.',
    'Your nervous system controls energy production, metabolism, sleep-wake cycles, and recovery. When there is interference in these pathways, your body cannot produce and manage energy effectively. A stressed nervous system burns energy constantly, disrupts restorative sleep, exhausts the adrenals, and prevents efficient repair. At Cultivate Wellness, our gentle, neurologically-focused approach removes this interference.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care cure chronic fatigue syndrome?',
      answer:
        'Chiropractic care does not cure ME/CFS. However, by optimizing nervous system function, many patients experience meaningful improvements in energy, sleep, pain, and overall quality of life. We address the nervous system component of fatigue, which is often overlooked in traditional treatment approaches.',

      question: 'How long before I start feeling better?',
      answer:
        'Chronic conditions take time to improve -- expect weeks to months for meaningful changes. Some patients notice subtle improvements early, while for others it takes longer. Dr. Zach will track your progress objectively and adjust your care plan as needed. Healing is not always linear.',

      question: 'Will the adjustments make me more tired at first?',
      answer:
        'Some patients experience temporary increased fatigue in the early stages of care as their nervous system begins to shift. This is normal and usually short-lived. Dr. Zach paces your care carefully to minimize this effect and will never overwhelm your system.',
