    'Allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues affect millions of people, often requiring ongoing medication. While chiropractic care does not treat allergies directly, it supports the nervous system and immune function that regulate your body\'s response to allergens. At Cultivate Wellness, many patients find significant improvement in their symptoms through regular chiropractic care.',
    'Your immune system is regulated by your nervous system. When there is interference to nervous system function, your immune system may overreact (allergies) or underperform. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses this underlying connection, helping your body respond more appropriately to environmental triggers.',

      question: 'Does chiropractic care cure allergies?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not treat or cure allergies directly. What it does is optimize nervous system function, which directly controls and coordinates your immune response. When your nervous system is functioning at its best, your body can respond more appropriately to allergens rather than overreacting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the spine affect allergies and breathing?',
      answer:
        'Your nervous system controls immune function, and the nerves that regulate your immune organs and respiratory system exit from specific areas of your spine. Neurological tension in the upper cervical, mid-cervical, and thoracic spine can interfere with these signals, potentially contributing to allergic reactions and breathing difficulties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can children benefit from chiropractic care for allergies?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Children\'s nervous systems are highly responsive to chiropractic care. Many parents report significant improvements in their child\'s allergies, asthma, chronic ear infections, and respiratory health after beginning care with our team.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I stop taking my allergy medications?',
      answer:
        'Never stop or change medications without consulting your prescribing physician. Chiropractic care supports your body\'s natural function and works alongside your medical care. Many patients find they naturally need less medication over time, which is a conversation to have with your doctor.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many visits before I notice improvement in my allergies?',
      answer:
        'Every person responds differently, so we don\'t estimate specific timelines until after completing a comprehensive history, consultation, and INSiGHT Scans. This initial evaluation helps our team understand how your nervous system may be contributing to your symptoms and develop a care plan tailored to your needs. We perform regular evaluations to track your progress.',
