    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic care really help with anxiety?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Anxiety has a significant physical component -- your autonomic nervous system gets stuck in "fight or flight" mode. Chiropractic adjustments help restore balance between the sympathetic (stress) and parasympathetic (calm) branches of your nervous system. Many patients experience meaningful improvements in anxiety symptoms through regular care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is chiropractic care a replacement for therapy or medication?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care is a wonderful complement to mental health treatment, not a replacement. If you are struggling with anxiety, we encourage you to work with a mental health professional alongside your chiropractic care. We are happy to coordinate with your other providers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is HRV and why does it matter for anxiety?',
      answer:
        'Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats, which reflects your autonomic nervous system balance. Low HRV is associated with anxiety, chronic stress, and poor health outcomes. We use HRV testing to objectively measure your stress levels and track improvement as your nervous system becomes more balanced.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the adjustments be uncomfortable for someone with anxiety?',
      answer:
        'Our gentle techniques are specifically designed to be calming rather than startling. There is no cracking, no sudden movements, and no forceful manipulation. Many anxious patients find our adjustments deeply relaxing and actually look forward to their visits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I be adjusted for anxiety and stress?',
      answer:
        'The frequency depends on your individual needs and how your nervous system responds. Our team will recommend a personalized care plan based on your initial evaluation. Many patients with anxiety benefit from more frequent visits initially, tapering as their nervous system stabilizes.',
