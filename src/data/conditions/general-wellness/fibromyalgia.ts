    'Living with fibromyalgia means dealing with widespread pain, fatigue, and often feeling misunderstood. At Cultivate Wellness, we recognize fibromyalgia as a real condition that affects real people. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach can help reduce pain, improve sleep, and support your overall quality of life.',
    'Research increasingly points to fibromyalgia as a condition of central sensitization, meaning the nervous system becomes hyperactive and amplifies pain signals. This is exactly where chiropractic care can help. By reducing interference to the nervous system and helping it function more normally, we may be able to help "turn down the volume" on your pain signals.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care cure fibromyalgia?',
      answer:
        'Chiropractic care does not cure fibromyalgia. However, by reducing nervous system interference and calming central sensitization, many patients experience significant improvements in pain, sleep, energy, and quality of life. We focus on helping your nervous system function more normally.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will the adjustments hurt? I am very sensitive.',
      answer:
        'Our techniques are specifically designed for sensitive patients. We use the lightest possible contact and adjust our approach based on your individual sensitivity level. Our instruments stimulate healing receptors, not pain receptors. Most fibromyalgia patients find our adjustments comfortable and even relaxing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is your approach different from regular chiropractic?',
      answer:
        'Traditional chiropractic often uses high-velocity thrusts that create cracking sounds. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach uses light touch and precise instrument adjustments that are much gentler. There is no cracking, no twisting, and no forceful manipulation, which is essential for fibromyalgia patients.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often will I need to come in?',
      answer:
        'Your frequency of care is determined after a detailed history, consultation, and after we study the results of your non-invasive, non-radiating comprehensive neurological [INSiGHT Scans](/insight-scans). Every fibromyalgia patient is different. We typically start gently and adjust the frequency of care as your body demonstrates it can handle more. Results vary from person to person.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with my other doctors?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. We believe in collaborative care and are happy to communicate with your rheumatologist, pain specialist, primary care doctor, or other providers. We see chiropractic care as one important component of a comprehensive fibromyalgia management plan.',
