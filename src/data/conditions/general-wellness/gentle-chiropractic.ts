  intro: [
    'Nervous about chiropractic care because you have heard about (or experienced) the cracking, popping, and twisting of traditional adjustments? You are not alone. Many people avoid chiropractic care they desperately need because they are afraid of forceful manipulation. At Cultivate Wellness, we specialize in gentle techniques that deliver excellent results without any of the things that make people nervous.',
    'Research shows that gentle, low-force techniques can be more effective than forceful manipulation because they work with your body rather than against it. Your nervous system responds better to precise, gentle input than to overwhelming force. Our patients often say they cannot believe how gentle the adjustments are, and how effective.',

      question: 'If there is no cracking, does it really work?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. The cracking sound in traditional chiropractic is just gas being released from a joint. It is not an indicator of effectiveness. Research shows gentle, low-force techniques can be equally or more effective because they work with your nervous system rather than against it. Your body responds better to precise, gentle input.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does an adjustment feel like?',
      answer:
        'Most patients describe our adjustments as comfortable and relaxing. You may feel a light tapping sensation from our instruments, gentle pressure from hands-on contact, or subtle shifts as your body responds. Many patients become so relaxed they nearly fall asleep during their adjustment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is gentle chiropractic safe for people with osteoporosis?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our techniques use controlled, gentle force that is safe for patients with bone density concerns. There is no rotation, twisting, or high-velocity manipulation. We can adjust you in any comfortable position, making care accessible for those with physical limitations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I had a bad experience at another chiropractor. Will this be different?',
      answer:
        'We hear this frequently, and yes, our approach is fundamentally different. We use only gentle, instrument-based and light-touch techniques. There is no cracking, no sudden movements, and no forceful manipulation. We explain everything before we do it, and you are always in control of your care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can babies and children really be adjusted?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our gentle techniques are perfectly suited for infants and children. The pressure used on a newborn is comparable to what you would use to test the ripeness of a tomato. Babies frequently sleep through their adjustments, and children often enjoy their visits.',
