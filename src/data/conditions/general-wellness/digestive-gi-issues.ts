    'Digestive problems affect millions of people, often despite medication and dietary changes. What many do not realize is that the nervous system plays a crucial role in digestive function. At Cultivate Wellness, we address the nerve interference that may be contributing to your digestive issues.',
    'Your digestive system is controlled by both the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system (your "second brain"). When there is interference to this communication, digestive problems often follow. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach helps restore proper nerve signaling to your digestive organs.',

      question: 'How does the spine affect digestion?',
      answer:
        'The nerves that control your digestive organs exit from specific areas of your spine. The vagus nerve exits from the brainstem and upper cervical spine and controls stomach acid and motility. Thoracic nerves (T5-T9) supply the stomach, liver, and small intestine. Lower thoracic and lumbar nerves supply the large intestine. When subluxations occur in these areas, digestive function can be compromised.',

    {
      question: 'Can chiropractic care help with infant digestive issues like colic?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Birth can be stressful to an infant\'s spine, and many babies with colic, reflux, constipation, and gas pain respond remarkably well to gentle chiropractic care. Dr. Zach uses extremely gentle techniques specifically adapted for infants.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I continue seeing my gastroenterologist?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Chiropractic care works well alongside other approaches to digestive health, including dietary changes, probiotics, and medical treatment when necessary. We support a collaborative approach to your health and encourage you to continue working with your medical team.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will my digestion improve?',
      answer:
        'Every person responds differently. Some patients notice improvement in digestive symptoms within the first few visits, while chronic conditions may take longer. Dr. Zach will track your progress through regular re-evaluations and adjust your care plan accordingly.',

        'Yes. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach is safe for patients with inflammatory bowel conditions. We do not treat these conditions directly, but by optimizing nervous system function, we support your body\'s ability to regulate inflammation and digestive function.',
