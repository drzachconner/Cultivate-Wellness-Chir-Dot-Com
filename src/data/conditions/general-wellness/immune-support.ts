At Cultivate Wellness, we help optimize your nervous system function to support a healthy, responsive immune system.',
    'Research has established clear connections between the nervous system and immune function. Immune organs like the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes are directly innervated by nerves. The brain and immune system constantly communicate. When there is interference in the nervous system, your immune system may not function optimally -- leaving you more vulnerable to illness.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic care really help my immune system?',
      answer:
        'Research has shown positive effects of chiropractic care on immune function, including improved white blood cell activity after adjustments, enhanced antibody production, and better inflammatory regulation. Your nervous system directly controls your immune response, so optimizing nervous system function naturally supports better immunity.',

    {
      question: 'Is chiropractic care a replacement for vaccines or medical treatment?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care supports immune function but does not replace medical care for infections or immune disorders. We work alongside your medical providers and encourage you to follow their guidance for preventive care and treatment of illness.',

      question: 'How often should I get adjusted for immune support?',
      answer:

    {
      question: 'What is the connection between stress and immunity?',
      answer:
        'Chronic stress puts your nervous system into "fight or flight" mode, which directly suppresses immune function. Your body redirects resources away from immune defense toward survival. Chiropractic care helps shift your nervous system back into balance, supporting both stress resilience and immune function.',
