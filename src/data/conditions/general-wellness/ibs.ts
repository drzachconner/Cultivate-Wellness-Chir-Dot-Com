  intro: [
    'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frustrating condition that affects millions of people, causing abdominal pain, bloating, and unpredictable bowel habits that disrupt daily life. At Cultivate Wellness, we support patients with IBS by addressing the nervous system dysfunction that plays a central role in this gut-brain disorder.',
    'IBS is increasingly recognized as a disorder of gut-brain communication. The enteric nervous system (your "second brain" in the gut) and the vagus nerve that connects your brain to your digestive system are directly influenced by spinal alignment and nervous system function. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach helps optimize this communication, supporting better digestive regulation and comfort.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure IBS?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not cure IBS. It addresses the nervous system dysfunction that contributes to gut-brain communication problems. By optimizing vagus nerve function and autonomic balance, many patients experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.',

      question: 'How does the spine affect digestion?',
      answer:
        'The vagus nerve controls much of your digestive function and runs from the brainstem through the upper cervical spine. The thoracic and lumbar spine supply nerves to the stomach, intestines, and colon. Spinal misalignments in these areas can interfere with the nerve signals that regulate digestion.',

    {
      question: 'Should I continue seeing my gastroenterologist?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. Chiropractic care complements your medical care. We encourage you to maintain your relationship with your GI doctor and any prescribed treatments. Our role is to support the nervous system function that underlies digestive health.',

    {
      question: 'How is your approach different for IBS patients?',

      question: 'How many visits before I notice digestive improvement?',
      answer:
        'Results vary. Some patients notice changes within the first few visits, while chronic IBS may take longer. Dr. Zach evaluates your progress regularly. Many patients report gradual but meaningful improvement over the first 4-8 weeks of care.',
