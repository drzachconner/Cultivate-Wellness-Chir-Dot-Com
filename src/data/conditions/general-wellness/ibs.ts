  intro: [
    'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frustrating condition that affects millions of people, causing abdominal pain, bloating, and unpredictable bowel habits that disrupt daily life. At Cultivate Wellness, we support patients with IBS by addressing the nervous system dysfunction that plays a central role in this gut-brain disorder.',
    'Most people have heard of the gut-brain connection, but what comes first, and is even more important, is the brain-gut connection. Your brain sends signals down through the vagus nerve to regulate nearly every aspect of digestive function. IBS is increasingly recognized as a disorder of this top-down communication. The vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system (your "second brain" in the gut) are directly influenced by spinal alignment and nervous system function. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach helps optimize this brain-to-gut signaling, supporting better digestive regulation and comfort.',

    label: 'The Brain-Gut Connection',
    text: 'While the gut-brain connection is well known, the brain-gut connection via the vagus nerve comes first. Your brain controls digestive function top-down through the vagus nerve, which runs from the brainstem through the upper cervical spine to the digestive system. IBS is fundamentally a breakdown in this communication. Optimizing vagus nerve function may help regulate digestive patterns.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure IBS?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not cure IBS. It addresses the nervous system dysfunction that contributes to gut-brain communication problems. By optimizing vagus nerve function and autonomic balance, many patients experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.',

The thoracic and lumbar spine supply nerves to the stomach, intestines, and colon. Neurological tension in these areas can interfere with the nerve signals that regulate digestion.',
