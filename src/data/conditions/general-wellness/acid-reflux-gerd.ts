  intro: [
    'Acid reflux and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) are more than just heartburn. They can significantly affect your quality of life, disrupt sleep, and lead to long-term complications if left unmanaged. At Cultivate Wellness, we support patients with reflux by addressing the nervous system function that controls digestion, rather than simply suppressing acid production.',
    'Your digestive system is controlled by the vagus nerve and the autonomic nervous system, both of which are directly influenced by spinal alignment, particularly in the upper cervical and mid-thoracic regions. When there is interference in these nerve pathways, it can affect esophageal function, stomach acid regulation, and the coordination of the digestive process. Our gentle, neurologically-focused approach addresses these underlying connections.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure GERD?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not cure GERD. It supports the nervous system function that controls digestion, including the vagus nerve that regulates the lower esophageal sphincter and stomach acid production. Many patients experience significant symptom improvement, but results vary.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic help infant reflux?',
