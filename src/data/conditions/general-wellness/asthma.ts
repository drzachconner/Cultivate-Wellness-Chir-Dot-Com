  intro: [
    'Asthma and breathing difficulties affect millions of people of all ages, often requiring daily medication and limiting activity. While chiropractic care does not treat asthma directly, it supports the nervous system function that controls your respiratory system. At Cultivate Wellness, many patients report significant improvement in their breathing after beginning our gentle, neurologically-focused care.',
    'Your ability to breathe freely depends on proper nerve signaling between your brain and your respiratory system. The nerves that control your diaphragm (the phrenic nerve from C3-C5), the muscles between your ribs, and the bronchial tubes all exit from your spine. When spinal misalignments interfere with these nerve signals, it can contribute to breathing difficulties, increased inflammation, and heightened airway reactivity.',

      question: 'Can chiropractic cure asthma?',
      answer:
        'No. Chiropractic care does not cure asthma. What it does is optimize the nervous system function that controls your respiratory system and inflammatory response. By removing interference in these pathways, many patients experience fewer and less severe episodes. Chiropractic care supports your body\'s ability to breathe more freely.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I stop using my inhaler?',
      answer:
        'Never stop or change medications without consulting your prescribing physician. Chiropractic care works alongside your medical treatment. Many patients find they naturally need their rescue inhaler less often, which is a conversation to have with your doctor.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can children with asthma benefit from chiropractic care?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Children respond particularly well to gentle chiropractic care. Many parents report significant improvement in their child\'s asthma symptoms, reduced need for medications, and fewer respiratory infections after beginning care with Dr. Zach.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a spinal misalignment affect breathing?',
      answer:
        'The nerves controlling your diaphragm exit from C3-C5, the nerves to your lungs exit from the thoracic spine, and the autonomic nervous system that regulates airway inflammation runs along your entire spine. Misalignments in these areas can interfere with nerve signaling, potentially contributing to breathing difficulties.',

    {
      question: 'How many visits before I notice improvement?',
      answer:
        'Results vary. Some patients notice easier breathing within the first few visits, while chronic asthma may take longer to show improvement. Dr. Zach will evaluate your progress regularly and adjust your care plan accordingly.',
